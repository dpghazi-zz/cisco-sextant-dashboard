Note: Using VPN to hide personal IP address ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
## **Project Description**
- The Sextant Networking Dashboard is a single-page application meant to assist field technicians with their day-to-day tasks. 
- This web application uses React for the frontend to display the user’s public IP addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6) and the packet latency associated with a service called Pylon. 
- The user's public IP addresses are fetched from the ipify API and the packet latency can be streamed using WebSocket connections.
