# Cisco Sextant App 
The Sextant Networking Dashboard is a single-page application meant to assist field technicians with their day-to-day tasks. This web application uses React for the frontend to display the userâ€™s public IP addresses (both ipv4 and ipv6) and the packet latency associated with a service called Pylon. The user's public IP addresses shall be fetched from the ipify API and the packet latency can be streamed using WebSocket connections.
